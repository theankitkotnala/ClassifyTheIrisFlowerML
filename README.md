# ClassifyTheIrisFlowerML
In this repo i have created a program which is totally based on the Machine learing . In this code i have used the sklearn library to import the tree , decisionTreeClassifier and  data of the iris flower . The data of the iris flower is diffrent to each other , here we have three types of the iris flower and in corresponds we have the 50 feature for each variety of the iris flower . So that means we have total 150 extracted features from all the three kind of iris flow .Son in this we willl predict the variety of iris flowers using the data we have .
you can use logistic regression also
